# Wavemaker

Adapted from https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-wavemaker.html

This illustrates how waves (like water waves) emerge from particles
oscillating in place. Move your mouse to direct the wave. Contributed by

```python
from proceso import Sketch


p5 = Sketch()
p5.describe("A grid of green spirals on a black background. The spirals change their motion based on the mouse position.")


def setup():
    p5.create_canvas(600, 600)
    p5.no_stroke()
    p5.fill(40, 200, 40)


def draw():
    p5.background(10, 10)  # translucent background (creates trails)

    # make a x and y grid of ellipses
    for x in range(0, p5.width, 30):
        for y in range(0, p5.height, 30):
            # starting point of each circle depends on mouse position
            x_angle = p5.remap(p5.mouse_x, 0, p5.width, -4 * p5.PI, 4 * p5.PI, True)
            y_angle = p5.remap(p5.mouse_x, 0, p5.height, -4 * p5.PI, 4 * p5.PI, True)
            # and also varies based on the particle's location
            angle = x_angle * (x / p5.width) + y_angle * (y / p5.height)

            # each particle moves in a circle
            t = p5.frame_count * 0.01
            my_x = x + 20 * p5.cos(2 * p5.PI * t + angle)
            my_y = y + 20 * p5.sin(2 * p5.PI * t + angle)

            p5.circle(my_x, my_y, 10)  # draw particle


p5.run_sketch(setup=setup, draw=draw)
