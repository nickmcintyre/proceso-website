# Hello!

proceso is a Python package for creative coding on the web, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! The package provides a Pythonic interface to the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library and is heavily inspired by [py5](https://py5coding.org). proceso is designed for [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)-based environments with a focus on [PyScript](https://pyscript.net).

Using the metaphor of a sketch, proceso has a full set of drawing functionality. However, youâ€™re not limited to your drawing canvas. You can think of your whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound. Similar to py5, proceso's goal is to integrate p5.js into the Python ecosystem with thoughtful choices about how to do so in the browser.

The example and reference pages are still under construction, but proceso is ready to use. You can read more on the [Getting Started](/welcome/getting_started) page or launch a starter project on the PyScript editor to start sketching immediately.

## Acknowledgements

- proceso is, first and foremost, an interface to the p5.js library. Nearly all of the package's documentation and examples are adapted from their p5.js counterparts. Portions of the source code are also adapted from the original JavaScript implementation.
- The `Vector` class is lovingly borrowed from py5 as are most of py5's naming conventions.
- [Basthon](https://framagit.org/basthon/), [Py5.js](https://github.com/Luxapodular/Py5.js), and [pyp5js](https://github.com/berinhard/pyp5js/) all pointed the way.
