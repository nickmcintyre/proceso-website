# Morph

Adapted from https://p5js.org/examples/motion-morph.html

Changing one shape into another by interpolating vertices from one to another.

```python
from proceso import Sketch

p5.describe("A white shape on a dark gray background repeatedly morphs between a square and a circle.")

# Two lists to store the vertices for two shapes
# This example assumes that each shape will have the same
# number of vertices, i.e. the size of each list will be the same
circle = []
square = []

# A list for a third set of vertices, the ones we will be drawing
# in the window
morph = []

# This boolean variable will control if we are morphing to a circle or square
state = False
